# My Personal Website

This is the source code to [my-website](https://pillzu.vercel.app). It's built using the following tools:
- Sveltekit
- SkeletonUI
- bun
- Vercel (for deployment)

## Goal & Intent
I built this website to keep myself accountable and actually share what I learn as I dive deeper into Computer Science and Business. I honestly believe I should have started early, but the second best time to do it is now. 
I hope I am able to provide valuable insights into common mistakes/epiphanies that most developers have on their journey and can actually improve your life in any way possible (even if it's a small impact).

P.S. Oh, and feel free to fork and change values to build your own blog. It's pretty simple and should actually help you get started right away. Good luck and off we go ðŸ”¥

## Developing
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `bun install`, start a development server.

```bash
bun dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of this website:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.
